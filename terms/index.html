    <p>We use blockchain to provide highly transparent digital services & competitive lottery platform solutions.</p>

<p>
Blockchain requires a public key to play along with some form of identification which makes it much safer than any other form of payment method because no one can steal your identity or lottery ticket from you.</p>

    <p>
As their name implies, crypto lotteries are lotteries played with cryptocurrencies. While the basic rules of the game remain the same (you buy a ticket, wait for the lottery game to start, and discover how much you've won)...1 DRAW= 1 WINNER.

Your hash is your bet, when we receive your payment, this information is registered in the blockchain and the payment is sent to the same address who made the payment. With a non-custodial wallet (METAMASK), you have sole control of your private keys.  </p>
